### Project Description
This project was made as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Development Course. 

I have created a cooking recipe app.\
Allowing users to discover new recipes and submit their own for other users to enjoy. 

Users can pin discovered recipes and manage their own submitted ones. 
An administration dashboard gives an overview of users, advertising and statistics.

    ## User Experience (UX)

    My intention was to create a simple app that presents its purpose immediately. 
    Users can easily discover & manage recipes. And can also submit and manage their own personal recipes. 
    Having previously designed my own layouts and styles, I wanted to use a front-end framework for this project. 
    The app has been built using [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) front-end framework.
